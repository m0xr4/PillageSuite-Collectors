# Pillage Suite Collectors
[![License: AGPLâ€¯v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository contains source code and compiled binaries for the standalone collectors, which can be used to enumerate and index data to create ready to use imports for [Pillage Suite](https://github.com/m0xr4/PillageSuite)

You can use these collectors to enumerate data without the graphical interface of Pillage Suite. This can be helpful in scenarios where you dont **can** or dont **want** to use the GUI for the collection of data, e.g. via a C2 session. The output files generated by these collectors can then be imported via [Pillage Suite](https://github.com/m0xr4/PillageSuite) to explore.


# Available Collectors

* Share Enumeration and index: Enuemrate and index shares, files and directories with all the required metadata and ACLs
